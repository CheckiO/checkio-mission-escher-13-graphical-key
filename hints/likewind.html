        As the input you will get 2D-array and the number N which shows the amount of elements of the array which will be used in the "graphical key". You can create all possibles pathes of length N from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and save this data as a list of lists.

    <div class="question">
        What should I do with those "pathes"?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
Every path is the list of numbers. You have to sum the numbers (for every "graphical key") and then choose the biggest sum.
